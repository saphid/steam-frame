# How the Frame is put together (field notes)

What we learnt by poking at a real Frame over SSH. Unless a line says
otherwise, it was **verified 2026-09-25** on SteamOS 0.3.0 (`VARIANT_ID=vr`,
build 20260922.6101926, kernel 6.18, aarch64). Topic docs go deeper. This page
is the map.

## The layer cake

```
SteamVR  (vrserver, vrcompositor, vrdashboard)       ← renders the room + panels
 └─ gamescope --backend openvr                       ← one SteamVR overlay per app id
     ├─ Xwayland :0  (Steam UI, games, tagged apps)  ← STEAM_GAME property = app id
     ├─ Xwayland :1  (STEAM_GAME_DISPLAY_0)
     ├─ Wayland socket gamescope-0
     └─ steamos-nested-desktop                       ← "the Linux desktop" panel
         └─ dbus-run-session startplasma-wayland
             └─ kwin_wayland 1280×800, Wayland wayland-0, Xwayland :2
                 └─ plasmashell, Konsole, Dolphin, Flatpaks you open there
Lepton (Android 11, podman container "lepton-dev") ← its own panel, app 3056000
```

## Facts worth knowing

| Fact | Where it matters |
|---|---|
| The desktop is a **nested** Plasma session: runtime dir `/run/user/1000/nested_plasma`, its own D-Bus bus, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0`, `DISPLAY=:2`. A plain `ssh frame app` can't find it. Copy the env from `plasmashell`'s `/proc/<pid>/environ`. | `run-on-frame.sh`, `paste-to-frame.sh` |
| The desktop size is hard-coded to 1280×800 in `/usr/bin/steamos-nested-desktop` (read-only rootfs). | [panels.md](panels.md) |
| gamescope runs with `--virtual-connector-strategy PerAppId`. Each app id becomes a SteamVR overlay `valve.steam.desktopgame.<id>`, which is a panel you can float. Setting `STEAM_GAME` on an X11 window on `:0` makes a new panel. | `panel-on-frame.sh`, [panels.md](panels.md) |
| Handy gamescope root properties on `:0`: `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSABLE_APPS`, `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSABLE_WINDOWS` (triples: window, app id, pid), `GAMESCOPE_FOCUSED_APP`. Read them with `DISPLAY=:0 xprop -root`. | Debugging panels |
| `gamescopectl screenshot <file>` (with `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=gamescope-0`) captures gamescope's flat layer. | Frame Control's capture |
| The **headset view** (both eyes, fully composited: room, panels, dashboard, controllers) comes from OpenVR `IVRScreenshots::RequestScreenshot(VRScreenshotType_Stereo)`. It's callable from `python3` with `ctypes` against `/opt/steamvr/bin/linuxarm64/libopenvr_api.so` as an overlay app. The compositor appends `.png`, writing a 1920×1080 side-by-side image (960×1080 per eye) plus a left-eye preview, in about 0.3s. In standby the frame is blank. `vrcmd --screenshot` and `vrcmd --compositorcmd screenshot_request` wrote nothing, even with `steamvr/rawCapturePath` set. | `ui/frame_vrshot.py` |
| SteamVR's `steamvr-v4l2cam.service` (`/opt/steamvr/bin/linuxarm64/v4l2cam --output=99`) copies the headset view (the `system.HeadsetView` mirror, one undistorted image) into the v4l2loopback device `/dev/video99` ("SteamVR"), 1920×1080 RGB24. `ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video99` reads it at about 70 new frames/s; the first frame read can be black. The Frame's hardware encoder (`iris_encoder`, `/dev/video-enc0`) crashes ffmpeg's `h264_v4l2m2m`, so encode with `libx264 -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency`: 720p30 takes about 0.7 of a core and 1080p60 about 1.7 (of 8). gamescope also publishes a PipeWire `gamescope` video source, but the Frame's GStreamer has no `pipewiresrc`. **Verified 2026-09-26.** | Frame Control's live video (`/api/stream`) |
| Battery: `/sys/class/power_supply/max1720x_bat_7-36` gives µV/µA (current is positive while charging), `time_to_full_now`/`time_to_empty_now` in seconds, and `temp` in tenths of °C. The charger shows up as `tcpm-source-psy-…` (`type=USB`, `usb_type=C PD [PD_PPS]`), for example 12 V × 1.67 A. | Frame Control's battery card |
| `vrcmd --stats` reports `activity_level` (3 = standby). | Telling whether the headset is being worn |
| The SteamVR dashboard has docking: Float in World, Move, Size, Curvature, controller docking, Theater, Multitasking View. **Inferred** from `/opt/steamvr/resources/webinterface/dashboard/` and not yet driven by hand. | [panels.md](panels.md) |
| SteamVR settings live in `~/.config/openvr/config/steamvr.vrsettings`, not under `~/.local/share/Steam/config/`. `dashboard.lastAccessedExternalOverlayKey` names the last panel you used. | Settings tweaks |
| The Steam client's journal (`journalctl --user`) carries SteamVR system UI lines such as `[Overlays] Created: …` and `vroverlay_uid<appid>`. It's the quickest way to see panels come and go. | Debugging |
| Present: `rsync`, `flatpak`, `python3`, `git`, `qdbus6`, `xrdp`, `xprop`, `xwininfo`, `xterm`, `konsole`, `dolphin`, `gamescopectl`. Missing: `wl-copy`, `xclip`, `xsel`, `kdeconnect-cli`, `tailscale` (installable in `~`, see below), `krfb`, `wayvnc`. | Script design |
| Flathub is a **system** remote. `--user` installs over SSH work and show up in the desktop menu. | `install-apps.sh` |
| `/` is 10 GB and read-only. `/home` is 929 GB. | Where to put things |
| Clipboard: Klipper over the nested D-Bus bus (`qdbus6 org.kde.klipper …`). | `paste-to-frame.sh` |
| Lepton listens for ADB on the Frame's loopback `5555`, so tunnel it over SSH. It's Android 11 (API 30), 64-bit ARM only, with no `clipboard` service: Compose < 1.11, SDL/Kivy and Godot 4.3 apps crash on launch. | [apks.md](apks.md), `apk-catalog/` |
| Lepton Development deletes every ADB-installed app when it exits (`clear_baked_app_data "non steamlaunch container"` in `…/common/Lepton/lepton`) unless `LEPTON_NO_CLEANUP` is set. | [apks.md](apks.md) |
| Any APK can run as its own Lepton instance: run `…/common/Lepton/lepton waitforexitandrun -- app.apk` with `SteamAppId` set and `STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH` under `~/.local/share/Steam`. Data persists and each gets its own container and panel. `frame/android/lepton-app.sh`, `ui/frame_android.py`. | [apks.md](apks.md) |
| The Steam client runs with `-cef-enable-debugging`, so its UI answers Chrome DevTools on loopback `127.0.0.1:8080`. The `SharedJSContext` page has `appStore` (owned apps), `downloadsStore` and `SteamClient.*`. `steam steam://install/<appid>` over SSH installs an owned game; when the options dialog shows (state 7), `SteamClient.Installs.ContinueInstall()` accepts it. **Verified 2026-09-25** with Balatro and Broforce. The Frame rating is `steam_hw_compat_category_packed >> 8 & 3`. | [steam-games.md](steam-games.md), `ui/frame_steam.py` |
| Chromium Flatpak 154 has **no immersive WebXR**: `navigator.xr` exists, but `isSessionSupported("immersive-vr")` returns `false`. Web VR180 players (DL8/DeoVR embeds) still play video inline as a flat, pannable view, and their VR button opens a tab on immersiveweb.dev. Forcing it doesn't help. `--enable-features=OpenXR,WebXR --force-webxr-runtime=openxr`, with `/opt/steamvr` and `XR_RUNTIME_JSON` exposed to the Flatpak, still returns `false`. The aarch64 Linux binary has no OpenXR code at all (no `XR_RUNTIME_JSON`, `xrGetInstanceProcAddr` or loader strings), even though `chrome://flags` lists `#webxr-runtime` → OpenXR. **Why (verified against source 2026-09-25):** M154 is the first release that compiles OpenXR on Linux (`enable_openxr` includes `is_linux`, `checkout_openxr` is true in Flathub's tarball, and Flathub's GN args don't turn it off). But `content/services/isolated_xr_device/xr_runtime_provider.cc` only creates an OpenXR device under `ENABLE_OPENXR && IS_WIN`, on 154, 155 and `main`. Nothing on Linux calls the OpenXR code, so the linker drops it. The missing pieces are two unmerged Gerrit CLs (bug 506004811): [8132979](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/8132979) wires the provider on Linux (with `kOpenXR` still off by default, so it needs `--enable-features=OpenXR`), and [8441736](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/8441736) runs the XR service in a sandbox that allows SteamVR's sockets. The Frame does have an aarch64 runtime: `~/.config/openxr/1/active_runtime.json` → SteamVR `bin/linuxarm64/vrclient.so`. To watch in 3D, use a native player, or a Chromium built with those two CLs ([webxr-chromium.md](webxr-chromium.md)). That build (156.0.8071.0, arm64) reports `immersive-vr` as supported and starts a session that SteamVR takes as its scene app. With the headset on, the WebXR samples scene and three.js's stereo 360 video demo showed in 3D (verified 2026-09-26, seccomp sandbox off). Started with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`, Chromium answers DevTools on loopback. **Verified 2026-09-25**, BUILD_ID 20260922.6101926. | Web video, [panels.md](panels.md) |
| **DeoVR (Steam app 837380, Windows/Unity) runs immersively** under Proton ARM64 + FEX: Unity's OpenVR XR plugin finds `OpenVR Headset(Steam Frame)` and the `frame_controller`, the GPU shows as Turnip Adreno 750, and AVPro Video decodes through `MF-MediaEngine-Hardware`. It played 7680×3840 and 8192×4096 H.265 VR180 SBS streams in dome/fisheye mode (`FirstFrameReady`). Unity's own `VideoPlayer` (used for grid thumbnails) fails with `0xc00d36bb`, so thumbnail previews stay blank. The first launch takes about 45 s (`ComputeShaders: InitAsync`). Log: `compatdata/837380/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Deo VR/Deo VR/Player.log`. **Verified 2026-09-25**, BUILD_ID 20260922.6101926. | [vr-video.md](vr-video.md) |
| **Wolvic (VR browser APK) runs in Lepton against SteamVR's OpenXR**, with limits. The stock Lynx build aborts (`Runtime doesn't support selected swapChain color format`: it wants `GL_RGBA8`), and the stock Quest build fails with `XR_ERROR_API_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`. Patching `DeviceDelegateOpenXR::GetSwapChainCreateInfo` in the Lynx build's `libnative-lib.so` to `GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8` (0x8C43) and re-signing fixes start-up. The Gecko engine then segfaults in `libxul`. The Chromium-engine build (Lynx v1.3-chromium) browses fine as an immersive app. Its page reports `isSessionSupported("immersive-vr") == true`, and `requestSession` succeeds, running about 36 rAF/s, but the headset shows **black** for WebXR content, or Wolvic's loading spinner that never clears, until the session is ended. Video decodes on the software `OMX.google.h264.decoder`. Tapping the URL bar's selection menu crashes it (no clipboard service). Open URLs with `am start -a VIEW -n com.igalia.wolvic/.VRBrowserActivity -d <url>` over the instance's ADB. DevTools is at `localabstract:content_shell_devtools_remote`. **Verified 2026-09-25**, BUILD_ID 20260922.6101926. | Web VR video, [apks.md](apks.md) |
| Tailscale runs without root as a userspace `tailscaled` user service (static arm64 build in `~/.local/share/tailscale`, lingering on). In userspace mode, inbound tailnet connections reach the Frame's **loopback**, so every port, including DevTools on 8080, is reachable from the tailnet. **Verified 2026-09-25.** | [tailscale.md](tailscale.md), `scripts/tailscale-on-frame.sh` |
| Power actions need `sudo`, which asks for the Developer Mode password over SSH. | Frame Control's power buttons |

## Debug recipes

```sh
# Which panels (app ids) exist right now?
ssh frame 'DISPLAY=:0 xprop -root GAMESCOPE_FOCUSABLE_APPS GAMESCOPE_FOCUSED_APP'

# Watch panels being created
ssh frame 'journalctl --user -f | grep --line-buffered "\[Overlays\]"'

# gamescope's full flags (in case Valve changes them)
ssh frame 'tr "\0" " " < /proc/$(pgrep -x gamescope | head -n 1)/cmdline'

# Everything the SteamVR dashboard can say (find hidden features)
ssh frame 'cat /opt/steamvr/resources/webinterface/dashboard/localization/dashboard_english.json'
```
