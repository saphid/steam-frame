# Installing APKs (Lepton)

The confidence labels are the same as in [ssh.md](ssh.md). Android apps run
in **Lepton**, Valve's Waydroid-based container. Lepton is built for games,
not general Android use
([GamingOnLinux](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/09/lepton-from-valve-to-run-android-games-on-linux-is-now-open-source/)).

## Install from the Mac: one app, one Lepton instance (verified 2026-09-25)

Use Frame Control's **Android apps** section (search, Install, Test, Report), drop
an `.apk` on **Send to Frame**, or:

```sh
./scripts/install-apk.sh some-app.apk            # own instance, Steam shortcut
python3 ui/frame_android.py list|launch|stop|remove|probe <package>
```

Each APK becomes its own app, the way T3 Code is set up (see the instance
section below), instead of going into Lepton Development:

1. `aapt2` reads the package, label, version, ABIs and icon. APKs that need
   API > 30 or have no `arm64-v8a` build are refused.
2. The APK, `frame/android/lepton-app.sh` (as `launch.sh`), `instance.id`,
   `meta.json`, the icon and the `lepton-show-flatscreen` marker go to
   `~/Applications/Android/<package>/` on the Frame.
3. A non-Steam shortcut is added through Steam's CEF debug port
   (`frame/android/steam_shortcuts.py`), with no Steam restart.
4. Launching the shortcut runs Lepton directly with `SteamAppId` set to the
   instance id (`2800000000 + crc32(package) % 70000000`). That's a
   "steamlaunch" context, so app data in `compatdata/<id>/internal` survives
   restarts and updates, and each app gets its own SteamVR panel. Several can
   run at once alongside Lepton Development, each in its own container
   (`lepton-steamlaunch-<id>`, ADB on 5556, 5557, …).

Verified with AntennaPod and Tabletop Tools: installed in about 7 s, launched
from the shortcut, stopped, and relaunched with their data intact. ADB and
Lepton Development aren't involved.

`--dev` keeps the old path: ADB into Lepton Development over an SSH tunnel
(first free Mac port from 15555), which starts Lepton Development if needed.
Apps installed that way are deleted when it exits (see below). No pairing or
"Allow debugging?" prompt is needed for either path.

Lepton Development must be installed once. Over SSH,
`ssh frame 'steam steam://install/3056000'` queues it, but the install still
needs to be confirmed or started in the headset.

## Installed apps disappear when Lepton Development closes (verified 2026-09-25)

Lepton Development runs in a throwaway "dev" context. When it exits for any
reason (you close it, or it crashes), the launcher script
`~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Lepton/lepton` calls
`clear_baked_app_data "non steamlaunch container"` and **deletes every app
installed over ADB**. The journal shows `Clearing baked app data due to non
steamlaunch container`, and `pm list packages -3` is empty afterwards.

The script skips the wipe when `LEPTON_NO_CLEANUP` is set
(`liblepton/liblepton.sh`, `clear_baked_app_data`). To keep your apps, set
Lepton Development's Steam launch options to:

```
LEPTON_NO_CLEANUP=1 %command%
```

(Steam → Library → Lepton Development → Properties → Launch Options.) Inferred
from the script, not yet tested across a restart.

## Which APKs work (verified 2026-09-25, SteamOS build 20260922.6101926)

Lepton is LineageOS 18.1 (`lepton_arm64_only`): Android 11, API 30,
`abilist=arm64-v8a` only, Mesa (Turnip, Adreno 750) with GLES 3.2 and
Vulkan 1.4. About 30 F-Droid apps were installed and opened on the Frame to
check each rule. The results are in the compatibility database (see compat-db/README.md).

**Won't install** (the installer refuses):

| Rule | Seen on device |
|---|---|
| `minSdkVersion` > 30 | `INSTALL_FAILED_OLDER_SDK: Requires newer sdk version #33 (current version is #30)` |
| Native code without `arm64-v8a` (32-bit ARM or x86 only) | `INSTALL_FAILED_NO_MATCHING_ABIS` |

**Crash on launch.** Lepton has no `clipboard` system service, so
`getSystemService(CLIPBOARD_SERVICE)` returns null:

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| **Jetpack Compose UI < 1.11** | Crashes as soon as a Compose screen appears: `null cannot be cast to non-null type android.content.ClipboardManager` in `AndroidComposeView`. Seen with 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 and 1.10 apps. |
| Jetpack Compose UI 1.11, 1.12, 1.13 | **Works.** Six apps opened fine, including Aurora Store and NewPipe. |
| Old Compose, but the first screen uses classic Views | Opens (FoCal, Compose 1.3), and crashes only on Compose screens |
| SDL2 apps, including Kivy | Crash: SDL calls `ClipboardManager.addPrimaryClipChangedListener` at start-up |
| Godot 4.3 | Crashes (clipboard cast). Godot 4.6.1 works. |

**Works:** classic Android Views apps, Flutter (2 of 2), libGDX (2 of 2),
Compose 1.11+, Firebase-using apps. React Native: 2 of 3 opened; one
(controlloid) died with SIGSEGV on the Hermes JS thread. A Qt 6 app
(AusweisApp) failed on a missing libc++ symbol.

**Missing pieces:** an app may open but fail when you use one of these:

- No Google Play Services.
- No activity for `VIEW` of web links, `OPEN_DOCUMENT`/`GET_CONTENT` (no file
  picker), `IMAGE_CAPTURE`, or text-to-speech. WebView (Chromium 152) is there.
- No Downloads or Contacts providers.
- Missing system services also include `accessibility`, `vibrator`, `phone`,
  `print`, `usb`, `nfc` and `autofill`. The declared features lack
  `touchscreen.multitouch`, `bluetooth_le` and `telephony`.
- No on-screen keyboard (IME) is installed. How text entry reaches Android
  apps in the headset hasn't been checked.

**Lepton itself can crash.** Three times during testing, the graphics HAL
(`android.hardware.graphics.composer@2.1-service`) aborted right after an app
crashed. SurfaceFlinger died, the whole `lepton-dev` container exited, and the
installed apps were wiped (see above). A retry of the same app worked, so it's
intermittent rather than app-specific.

**How good are the predictions?** In a random sample of 12 apps rated "Should
work", all 12 installed, opened and were still running 12 s later (two needed
a retry because Lepton crashed mid-install). "Opened" isn't the same as fully
working: see the missing pieces above.

## Catalogue and compatibility reports

Frame Control's **Android apps** section lists every F-Droid app with a
verdict: Works on Frame, Should work, Might work, Probably crashes, or Won't
work, with the reasons. As of 2026-09-25 that's 30 working, 3,323 should work,
223 might work, 723 probably crash (mostly Compose < 1.11) and 156 won't
install. Each app is rated on its newest version that Lepton can install,
because F-Droid often publishes separate per-ABI builds and the newest is
frequently x86_64. **Install** downloads the APK (SHA-256 checked against the
F-Droid index) and sets it up as its own instance.

No ProtonDB-style database for sideloaded Android apps on the Frame existed
as of 2026-09-25. [Steam Frame Hub](https://verified.steamframehub.com/)
collects community reports for Steam games only and has no public API, and
Valve's "Great on Frame" badges and each Steam app's `recommended_runtime`
(for example `lepton-stable`) also cover Steam games only
([VR.org](https://vr.org/articles/steam-frame-lepton-android-runtime-52-of-130-certified-2026)).
So we keep our own, in a private Lakebed database
(`https://frame-compat.lakebed.app`) that only Frame Control can read or write.
**Test** records whether the app stays up in its own instance, and **Report**
(for any APK, F-Droid or not) records whether it worked, how it was run, where it came from, and notes, each with the SteamOS and Lepton build ids.
A daily job backs it up locally and to Google Drive. See
[compat-db/README.md](../compat-db/README.md) and
[apk-catalog/README.md](../apk-catalog/README.md).

## In-headset app store: F-Droid 1.17 (verified 2026-09-25)

F-Droid 1.23 uses an old Compose and crashes on launch. **F-Droid 1.17.2**, the
newest archived build without Compose, runs, loads the full catalogue (the
first repo update takes about 90s), and can install apps. F-Droid 2.0 uses
Compose 1.12, so it should work, but it hasn't been tried. The catalogue's
Install button for F-Droid installs 1.17.2. To let F-Droid install apps without
a settings prompt, with the tunnel open:

```sh
adb -s $S shell appops set org.fdroid.fdroid REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES allow
```

## Handy commands

Open a tunnel by hand (use any free local port):

```sh
ssh -f -N -M -S /tmp/frame-adb.sock -L 127.0.0.1:15555:127.0.0.1:5555 frame
adb connect 127.0.0.1:15555
S=127.0.0.1:15555
# when done: adb disconnect $S; ssh -S /tmp/frame-adb.sock -O exit frame
```

Then:

```sh
adb -s $S shell pm list packages -3              # installed third-party apps
adb -s $S shell monkey -p <pkg> -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
# If monkey exits with -5 (it did for T3 Code), start the activity directly:
adb -s $S shell am start -W -n "$(adb -s $S shell cmd package resolve-activity --brief -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER <pkg> | tail -n 1)"
adb -s $S logcat -d -b crash                      # why an app died
adb -s $S uninstall <pkg>
adb -s $S exec-out screencap -p > shot.png        # the Lepton window
```

## Reaching a Mac service from Lepton (T3 Code v2, verified 2026-09-25)

Lepton runs in podman with `pasta` networking. It has **its own loopback**, so
a port on the Frame's `127.0.0.1` isn't visible as `127.0.0.1` inside Android.
But pasta runs with `--map-gw`, so the **gateway address inside Lepton
(`192.168.1.1` on the home network) maps to the Frame host's loopback**.

T3 Code v2 on the Mac listens only on `127.0.0.1:3873`. To reach it:

1. The LaunchAgent `~/Library/LaunchAgents/frame-t3-tunnel.plist`
   keeps `ssh -N -R 127.0.0.1:3873:127.0.0.1:3873 frame` running. launchd
   restarts it if it drops. Log: `~/Library/Logs/frame-t3-tunnel.log`.
2. In the app on the Frame, the environment host is `192.168.1.1:3873`.

The app on the Frame was built from the v2 nightly source (fork commit
`d0c468e3`) with `expo prebuild` and `gradlew assembleRelease
-PreactNativeArchitectures=arm64-v8a`, using Homebrew `openjdk@17` and the
`android-commandlinetools` SDK. It's signed with the debug key.

To pair again, issue a one-time code on the Mac and type it into
**Add environment**:

```sh
A="/Applications/T3 Code (V2 Preview).app"
ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 "$A/Contents/MacOS/T3 Code (Alpha)" \
  "$A/Contents/Resources/app.asar/apps/server/dist/bin.mjs" \
  auth pairing create --base-dir "$HOME/.t3-v2" --ttl 15m --label "Steam Frame"
```

The app is deleted whenever Lepton Development closes (see above), so reinstall
it afterwards or set `LEPTON_NO_CLEANUP=1`. The gateway address comes from the Frame's network when Lepton starts. On a
different network, check it with `adb shell ip route` and edit the host.

## Lepton Development forgets apps; give an app its own instance (verified 2026-09-25)

**Lepton Development wipes every installed app when it exits.** Its launcher
logs `Clearing baked app data due to non steamlaunch container`, unless
`LEPTON_NO_CLEANUP` is set. A Steam-style launch (with `SteamAppId` set) is a
"steamlaunch" context and keeps its data:

- App data lives in `STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH/internal/<package>` (symlinked to
  `/data/data/<package>`) and survives everything, including APK updates.
- `STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH/baked` is Lepton's Android snapshot. It's rebuilt when
  the APK changes, or when the app exits within 30 seconds of starting.
- `STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH` must be under `~/.local/share/Steam` (use
  `steamapps/compatdata/<id>`). Only that tree is mounted in the container. Put
  it anywhere else and the symlinks dangle, so the app crashes with
  `ENOENT` on its first file write.
- Lepton runs apps headless unless an empty `lepton-show-flatscreen` file sits
  next to the APK (`STEAM_COMPAT_INSTALL_PATH`).
- Several instances can run at once. Each gets ADB on `5555 + offset`
  (`podman ps --format "{{.Names}} {{.Labels.adb_port}}"`).
- Outside Steam, Lepton's `setpgid --foreground` re-exec fails with no
  terminal. Set `IS_PARENT=true` and start it with `setsid --wait`.

[`frame/t3code/launch.sh`](../frame/t3code/launch.sh) does all this for T3
Code (context `steamlaunch-2873873873`; ADB is the first free `5555 + n`, e.g. 5557). It needs the Steam client
running (it mounts `~/.steam/steam.pipe`).

**T3 Code in the Steam library (verified 2026-09-25).** The wrapper lives on
the Frame at `~/Applications/T3Code/launch.sh`, with `t3code.apk` and the
flatscreen marker next to it. It's a non-Steam shortcut called "T3 Code"
(shortcut app id `3130509679`). Launching it from Steam gets its own SteamVR
panel, `valve.steam.desktopgame.3130509679`, and opens already paired.

- The shortcut was added without restarting Steam, through Steam's CEF debug
  port (`127.0.0.1:8080` on the Frame, target `SharedJSContext`):
  `SteamClient.Apps.AddShortcut(name, exe, "", "")`, then `SetShortcutName`
  and `SetShortcutStartDir`. `steam steam://addnonsteamgame/<path>` only logged
  the URL and added nothing.
- To launch it over SSH: `steam steam://rungameid/13445436691150012416`, which
  is `(3130509679 << 32) | 0x02000000`.
- Steam sets `STEAM_FOSSILIZE_DUMP_PATH` for shortcut launches but not
  `STEAM_COMPAT_SHADER_PATH`. Lepton then dies with "unbound variable", so the
  wrapper sets both.
- To update T3, replace `t3code.apk`. Lepton rebuilds its snapshot on the next
  launch, and the pairing survives.

## Crashing apps can take down the headset session (verified 2026-09-25)

Some apps crash Android's graphics composer HAL, which kills the Lepton
container. On 2026-09-25 a batch crash-test also coincided with `steamvr.service`
restarting "on client request", which stops and SIGKILLs `gamescope-session`.
After one of those kills, gamescope crash-looped about once a second on
`rendervulkan.cpp:2181 ... Assertion '!modifiers.empty()'` because it kept
attaching to the SteamVR processes orphaned from the dead session. The fix
without sudo was to `for p in vrdashboard vrcompositor vrserver; do pkill -TERM -x $p; done` (pkill takes one pattern). The
next session then started SteamVR fresh and recovered within a minute.

## Android display: resolution, UI scale, text size (verified 2026-09-25, SteamOS 0.3.0, build 20260922.6101926)

Each running Lepton instance has its own ADB port on the Frame, assigned at
launch: 5555 is Lepton Development, and own-instance apps take the next free
port (T3 Code was on 5557). Find them with `ss -ltn` (5555–5599) and identify
each with `pm list packages -3`. Both instances reported `Physical size:
1920x1080`. Their densities were 180 dpi (Lepton Development) and 213 dpi
(T3 Code), and `settings get system font_scale` returned `null` (1.0).

These all apply immediately and read back as set. Tested on Lepton Development
only:

```sh
adb -s $S shell wm size 2560x1440         # or: wm size reset
adb -s $S shell wm density 240            # or: wm density reset
adb -s $S shell settings put system font_scale 1.15
adb -s $S shell settings delete system font_scale
```

After a `wm` reset, Android writes `font_scale=1.0` back asynchronously, so a
single delete that follows one reads back `1.0`. A second delete a second later
leaves it `null`. Frame Control's **Android display** card does this for you
(`/api/android/display`).

**Inferred, not yet checked in the headset:** a bigger Android resolution with
density scaled to match (2560×1440 at 4/3 of the density) gives sharper text,
because gamescope scales Lepton's surface to fit the same panel. Also unverified:
whether the settings survive the app or its Lepton instance relaunching.
Lepton Development rebuilds its Android data on exit, so there they probably
don't.
